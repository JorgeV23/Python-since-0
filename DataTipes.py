#Way to create a variable with a specific data type
x = str("Hello World")

#List: You can modify the information into the list 
y=["Jorge","Hernan","Valencia"]

#Tuple: It's and immutable
z=("Jorge","Hernan","Valencia")

#Dict: It's a dictionary, I mean you can add a meaning for a word
u = dict(name="John", age=36, country="Norway")

#You can set the data type to a variable by this way

q=1
q=float(q)
#Now q will be a float number 1.0
b = 5.5
xb= int(x)
